## Sprinkler demo app for dropping Ember into Rails apps

This app shows 2 ways to "sprinkle" Ember into your Rails app. It's in support of an Austin on Rails talk given in Feb. 2014.
Slides are here:
https://speakerdeck.com/tehviking/a-sprinkling-of-ember

The first technique is embedding Ember components into an existing app rather than a jQuery hairball.

You can see more details in a blog post here:

The second technique is actually mounting an Ember routed application at a sub-route of your Rails app.

There's no blog post for this yet, but expect one in the near future.
